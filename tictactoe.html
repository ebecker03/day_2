    <!-- Take the following Divs and practice by adding the specific styling of a tic tac toe 
        board as per the instructions in the divs below -->

    <!-- Each of the below should have a height and width of 100px
         All even elements should have a grey background and all odd elements should have a white background.
        The divs should be centered in the middle of the page (this can be done by using a left margin on 1,4,7 or alternative methods)
        Any DIV in the winning middle row should have a green background. Do ALL of this without adding any classes. 
        For bonus points, change the font size to fill the divs as well.
